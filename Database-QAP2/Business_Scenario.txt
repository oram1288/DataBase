Business Scenario:

A local sports league, "Mount Pearl Blades" organizes seasonal hockey tournaments.
To manage the increasing number of teams and participants, Mount Pearl Blades needs 
a database to store and manage its information effectively. The database will keep 
track of team details, player profiles, match schedules, and results. For each player, 
the database will store information such as name, age, contact details, and performance 
statistics. Additionally, the database will maintain records of arenas, including 
availability booking schedules and what rink each game is played in. This organized 
system will help the Mount Pearl Blades manage its operations, ensure smooth scheduling, 
and provide detailed performance analytics, ultimately improving the overall management 
of the league.
